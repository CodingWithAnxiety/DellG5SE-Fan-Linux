# DellG5SE-Fan-Linux
The Dell G5SE-5505 laptop isn't working with usual fan managers, this script is a small utility to automatically set fan speed according to cpu and gpu thermals.
## Requirements
You will need to modprobe the dell smm kernel module, which is not loaded by default on this laptop.
```shell
$ sudo modprobe dell-smm-hwmon restricted=0 ignore_dmi=1
```
If you want this setting to stay upon reboot, you can create a / replace by or append to the config file  `/etc/modules-load.d/dell-smm-hwmon.conf` 
```shell
dell-smm-hwmon
```
and the same for `/etc/modprobe.d/dell-smm-hwmon.conf` 
```shell
# This file must be at /etc/modprobe.d/
options dell-smm-hwmon restricted=0 ignore_dmi=1
```
For the CPP version, which is writing to directly to the embedded controller, you will need to allow EC writing, by following [these steps](https://github.com/YoyPa/isw/wiki/How-to-configure-ec_sys-with-write_support=1).
## Usage

### Cpp Version
Approximatively the same as the python script as usage. EC writing gives (much more) fan control.
```shell
$ DellFan -h
Usage :
sudo DellFan [-s left_fan_speed right_fan_speed] [-l t1 t2 t3 t4] [-t timer] [-r ] [-b]

Arguments description :
 -h, --help             show this help message and exit.
 -s, --set left right   sets left/rights fan to selected speed (from 0 to 255).
 -l, --loop t1 t2 t3 t4 given the temperature thresholds t1, t2, t3, t4 (in Â°C),
                        adjusts the fan speed accordingly with a loop.
 -t, --timer t          set the loop timer (in seconds). Default is 20s.
 -m, --manual           Switch to manual fan mode.
 -r, --restore          Gives back the fan control to the BIOS.
 -b, --boost            Set fan speed to BOOST (as fn+F7).
 -v, --verbose          Prints loop fan updates. -1 means no fan update made.

```
![Fan curve](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DavidLapous/DellG5SE-Fan-Linux/main/fan_curve.svg)

For a better ease of use, you can put this script in your binaries path `/usr/bin/DellFan` and ask `sudo` not to ask your password everytime you use it by adding the line
```
ALL ALL=(root) NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/DellFan
```
to your `sudoers` file.

This also should allow you to map profiles / fan speeds to keyboard shortcuts via your display environment (gnome / kde / ...).

:warning: Be careful ! Too high temperatures can permanently damage your hardware.

## Todo
- [x] Make a config file
  - [ ] Live update on temp changes in config file
- [ ] Gnome extension / PySimpleGUI with system tray 
  - [ ] Temperature monitoring, temp graphs.
  - [ ] Update profile / Fan speed.
  - [ ] Keyboard shortcut, complicated with wayland I don't really know how to deal with it.
- [x] Cpp version 
  - [ ] gui.
  - [ ] Fan curve fixes.
  - [ ] Remove the Dell-smm-hwmon kernel module dependance.
- [x] Direct EC editing.
  - [x] GPU part.
  - [x] CPU part.
  - [x] Manual trigger. 
- [ ] Tell me
